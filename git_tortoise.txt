TortoiseGit is a Windows Shell Interface to Git based on TortoiseSVN. 

It's open source and can be built entirely with freely available software.

TortoiseGit supports you with regular tasks, such as committing, showing logs, diffing two versions, creating branches and tags.

It can act as a standalone application too.
