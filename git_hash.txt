Git hashing function is similar to hashing used in Software programming.

The hashing function is used for creating KEYS in dictionary datatype.

It creates an unique ID for the key value therefore it does not allows duplicate data and also prevents collision.

Also using a Unique ID means accessing time is fast with average time complexity being O(1) and worst being O(n).

It uses a strong SHA-1 encryption.
